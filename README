The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. 
With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. 
Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article.
Using this project, we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. 
Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. 
By using those properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on real world datasets. 
We have used 6 Machine Learning algorithms for the same. These include:
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Tree Classifier
• XG Boost
• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
• Random Forest Classifier
• Naïve Bayes
